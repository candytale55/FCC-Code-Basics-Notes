# Frontend Basics Archive

This repository is a collection of frontend web development exercises, notes, and projects gathered since 2019. It includes a variety of code samples primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some React, Bootstrap, jQuery, and other related technologies.

## Purpose

- Archive and backup of learning projects from FreeCodeCamp (FCC) and various other tutorials.  
- Reference for foundational frontend concepts and patterns.  
- A place to experiment and explore different web development topics.

## Contents

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web development exercises and small projects.  
- **React & Bootstrap**: Recent projects using modern frontend libraries.  
- **Legacy code**: Early-stage or basic projects that helped build up skills.  
- **Notes and references**: Documentation, explanations, and supplementary materials.

## Organization

Projects and notes are organized by folders named descriptively. While the repository contains work of varying quality and completeness, the folder and file names are designed to help you quickly find what youâ€™re looking for.

## Future Plans

This repository will eventually be archived. A new dedicated portfolio repository will showcase polished projects with up-to-date best practices and full documentation.
