# choore_door_game

JS, html & css single-page website with fully-functional game. Three doors, you have to chose and open one, and you lose if you get the chore bot on the first or second try. You win if you get to the third.

Third commit - Added html instructions section and CSS for styling. Re-did the function randomChoreDoorGenerator and the if-else loop inside it. 

There's an ERROR : The img are not loading correctly (broken image). I already tested using the relative paths directly in randomChoreDoorGenerator and the results are the same. It works when the variable e.g. spaceDoorPath are used directly, but not when it is assigned inside randomChoreDoorGenerator.
