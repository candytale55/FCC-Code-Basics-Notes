>Getting_Started_DataStructs

## General info
Nodes are the building blocks for many of the data structures to follow. The motivation of this project is to understand the concept of node in data structures (self practice.) There are two files here: 


### Node.js 
Create a basic node that contains data and one link to another node. The node’s data will be specified when creating the node and immutable (can’t be updated). A node’s link to the next node is null when there are no nodes to traverse.


### Node_Class_Ice_Cream_Shop.js
A file with a practical example. Description is as follows: _ice cream shop that sells three flavors: strawberry, vanilla, and coconut. The signature sundae is made of these three flavors, but our new hires have a hard time remembering the order._
