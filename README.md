# String Manipulation Examples - Javascript

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. These are my personal notes. 

## Description of functions: 

Function repeatStringNumTimes repeats a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Example of different solutions.

The _sentensify_ function takes an argument _str_. The string is not divided by spaces, but for hyphens, points, commas, etc.  
This uses the split method to get ridded by the non-word characters and the join method to make a sentence from the words in the string str. 

### Note to self: if not here, check also these:
* [Check_string_endings_JS] (https://github.com/candytale55/Check_string_endings_JS)

#### To-do list:
* Do everything in Python (just for fun).
* Go see if you can use recursion or simplify them. 

## Technologies
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
