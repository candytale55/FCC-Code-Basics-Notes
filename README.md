# typography_practice_three_tabs
This is fake blog site that displays fonts of different sizes and styles. It shows four links in a navigation bar on top. The landing first part titled _"Favorite Fonts"_ is an introduction to what Typography is, and there are three additional links titled _SERIF_, _SANS-SERIF_ and _MONOSPACED_ that takes you to the section of the page where each different style is explained and examples are shown.
