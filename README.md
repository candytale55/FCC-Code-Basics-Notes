# JS_Loops_with_Nested_Arrays_examples
JavaScript examples for iterators on nested arrays to find or modify one or more elements on nested arrays. Learning notes.  

## General info
The purpose of the project is just personal learning. I may revisit this code to find different solutions. 

## Description
Examples of iterating arrays and especially nested arrays with for loops, either to find one or more elements or manipulate the array based on which data items meet a certain criteria. 

Focused on the for loop, not in built-in (such as every(), forEach(), map(), etc.)

#### To-do list:
* Do the same with built-in methods.
* Do the same in Python.

## Technologies
* Javascript ES6

## Setup
NA - It's only coding examples, there's no setup.

## Status
Project is: _finished_, - Kept as notes for future reference.

## Based
Based on FreeCodeCamp's excercises.
