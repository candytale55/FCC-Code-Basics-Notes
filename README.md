# Repeat_A_String_JS
Function repeatStringNumTimes repeats a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Example of different solutions.

The _sentensify_ function takes an argument _str_. The string is not divided by spaces, but for hyphens, points, commas, etc.  
This uses the split method to get ridded by the non-word characters and the join method to make a sentence from the words in the string str.
