# Accessibility Quiz with HTML & CSS

A practice project that builds an accessible quiz form using semantic HTML and responsive CSS. This exercise focuses on making content usable for all people, including those with disabilities — following accessibility principles such as screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and alternative text.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure with accessibility features like `aria` roles and labels
- **CSS3** – Responsive layout, styling for readability, and hover interaction

## Main Features

- Accessible structure using `fieldset`, `legend`, and ARIA roles
- Keyboard-navigable form elements and navigation links
- Text alternatives for images (`alt` attribute)
- Smooth scrolling for improved usability (prefers-reduced-motion aware)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile viewports

## Setup Instructions

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure both `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Use It

- Use the project as a reference for accessible form-building practices.
- Test keyboard-only navigation to understand accessibility behavior.
- Explore screen reader functionality by enabling it in your OS or browser.
- Modify form sections to add new questions or improve accessibility features.

## Project Status

✅ Completed as a learning exercise in accessible web development.
